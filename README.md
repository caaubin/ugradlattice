Lattice QCD code written by and for undergraduates

This is a suite of Lattice QCD code written by Fordham University undergraduates to 
simulate basic lattice systems. Currently available here are those based upon work primarily 
by Michael Creutz from the early 1980s (as those are simplest to simulate). Currently in the code are:

SU(2) QCD:
Initialize 2-color quenched lattices (hot or cold start)
Generate configurations (with metropolis or heat bath algorithm) with a simple Wilson plaquette action
Determine the average plaquette
Set up Wilson-Dirac operator for the quark propagator (being tested)
Extract the pion correlator for a quenched ensemble (being tested)
Determine n x m Wilson loops to extract the string tension (under development)

SU(2) QCD:
Initialize 2-color quenched lattices (hot or cold start)
Generate configurations (with metropolis or Cabibbo-heat bath algorithm) with a simple Wilson plaquette action
Determine the average plaquette
Set up Wilson-Dirac operator for the quark propagator (under development)
Extract the pion correlator for a quenched ensemble (under development)
